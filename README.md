# term-project-group-24 - Luigi's Legally Distinct Haunted Mansion

## What It Is

Our project is a simple 3D first person game. You are trapped in a location
swarming with rotund ghosts and you must use your trusty flashlight to destroy
as many of them as you can! The game uses WASD tank controls for movement and
the direction of your flashlight is controlled with IJKL.
